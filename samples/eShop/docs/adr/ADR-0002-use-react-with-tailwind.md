# ADR-0002 - Use React with Tailwind

## Status
PROPOSED
Date: 2024-03-20

## Context
To improve the development speed and maintainability of our front-end code, we need a modern UI framework and a utility-first CSS framework.

## Decision
We will use React for building user interfaces and Tailwind CSS for styling. This combination will:
- Enhance developer productivity
- Ensure a consistent design system
- Simplify the process of creating responsive designs

## Consequences
- Faster development cycles
- Easier maintenance of UI components
- Potential learning curve for team members unfamiliar with React or Tailwind
- Dependency on third-party libraries

## Alternatives Considered
1. Angular with Bootstrap
   - Steeper learning curve
   - More opinionated structure
2. Vue with Bulma
   - Less community support
   - Different design philosophy
