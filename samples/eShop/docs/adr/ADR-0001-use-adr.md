# ADR-0001 - Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status
ACCEPTED
Date: 2024-03-19

## Context
As our system grows, we need to document important architectural decisions for future reference and to maintain a clear understanding of why certain choices were made.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in our project. ADRs will:
- Be stored in docs/adr/
- Be numbered sequentially
- Follow the template format
- Be written in Markdown
- Be reviewed through pull requests

## Consequences
- Improved documentation of architectural decisions
- Better onboarding for new team members
- Clear historical record of system evolution
- Additional overhead in documentation maintenance

## Alternatives Considered
1. Wiki pages
   - Less version control
   - Harder to review changes
2. Informal documentation
   - Lacks structure
   - Can become outdated easily
