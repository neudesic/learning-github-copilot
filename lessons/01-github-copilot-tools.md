## Lesson 01 - GitHub Copilot Tools

Explore the different tools available within GitHub Copilot to enhance your development workflow. Below are sections highlighting each tool, including detailed descriptions, use cases, and links to dedicated labs for hands-on learning.

## Overview

GitHub Copilot provides developers with powerful AI-assisted coding tools designed to streamline coding, debugging, optimization, and automation tasks. These tools integrate seamlessly into various development environments, improving productivity and efficiency across multiple stages of the software development lifecycle.

### 1. GitHub Copilot Ask

Engage interactively with Copilot to ask questions, request code suggestions, and optimize your code directly within a conversational interface. Copilot Ask is ideal for understanding existing code, exploring implementation strategies, and generating complex code snippets through conversational prompts.

**Example use cases:**

- Clarifying the logic of unfamiliar or complex code.
- Requesting code examples or implementations of specific features.
- Improving existing code with optimization suggestions.

### 2. GitHub Copilot Edit

Use Copilot Edit to perform extensive refactoring and optimizations across larger codebases by providing comprehensive context-aware edits. Copilot Edit analyzes the entire file or multiple files to suggest impactful, cohesive changes, significantly enhancing code maintainability and readability.

**Example use cases:**

- Refactoring legacy code to adhere to modern coding standards.
- Updating methods or classes across multiple files to ensure consistency.
- Optimizing large code blocks or implementing significant logic changes.
